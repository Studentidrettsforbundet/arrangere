# General feedback 
- Setup linting with Prettier and Eslint. It makes the codebase so much cleaner :) 
- Maybe include firebase-emulator setup in a npm-command?
- Consider using store instead of recoil? 
- Please improve your readme with your decision and choices 
- I would suggest that you create a `routes`-folder where you collect all the pages of the app to improve the organization
